# Machine Learning RoadMap - Self-Learning AI

> **Note**:
> When I say learn something, I mean learn it in detail and write about it on my website [Zero to Mastery Learn Machine Learning and Deep Learning Concepts](https://jamormoussa.github.io/docs/).


## 01. Learn scikit-learn's User Guide

Scikit-learn's website provides a detailed user guide for the `sklearn` library for different machine learning tasks. This user guide page offers detailed section navigation containing interesting topics in machine learning. Here are the top three topics on the list:

1. Supervised learning

2. Unsupervised learning

3. Model selection and evaluation

For this, I created a GitHub repository containing all the content. The job is to learn about some parts of it over time and add the corresponding notebook to it:

Github repo **Machine-Learning-With-Scikit-Learn**: [https://github.com/JamorMoussa/Machine-Learning-With-Scikit-Learn](https://github.com/JamorMoussa/Machine-Learning-With-Scikit-Learn)

When some sections are completed, I will add them to my website.

Here are some useful links:

## 02. Learn About Optimizers for Deep Learning

1. Learn about gradient-based optimization algorithms for deep learning, including **stochastic gradient descent (SGD)**, **AdaGrad**, **Adam**, etc.

2. Make a full comparison analysis of all these algorithms, highlighting the advantages and drawbacks of each of them.

3. Work on some helping extensions and functions (Python library) that provide some plots of hyperparameters of each of these optimizers to help understand them better and assist in deciding which optimizer may be useful for a specific task.

## 03. Deep Learning Architectures

1. **Convolutional Neural Networks**:

    - Learn about **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and their applications in computer vision tasks, e.g. **Object Detection/Recognition**, **Segmentation**, **Object Tracking**, etc.

    - Go further by using **Transfer Learning** with some advanced CNN architectures, including **VGG**, **ViT**, **LeNet**, **AlexNet**, **GoogLeNet**, **ResNet**, etc.

    - Understand the **YOLO** algorithm, which is one of the best computer vision algorithms nowadays.

2. **Recurrent Neural Networks**:

    - Learn about **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** and their variations, such as **LSTMs** and **GRUs**, and their applications in sequence data modeling, e.g. text, audio, videos, and their use cases for different ML tasks, including **Sentiment Analysis**, **Time Series Forecasting**, **Language Modeling**, and more.

3. **Transformers and LLMs**:

    - Understand the **Transformer** architecture (which is at the heart of ChatGPT), the **Attention Mechanism**, and its application in the fields of **NLP** and **Computer Vision**.

    - Explore different architectures for different tasks, such as **BERT** for sentiment analysis, **GPT** for text generation (e.g. **Llama2**, **Gemma**), and **ViT** for vision tasks.

4. **Generative AI**:

    - Explore the **GAN** architecture for image generation and apply them to solve specific problems.

    - Rewrite the **AutoEncoder** documentation, explore its variations like **Variational AutoEncoders (VAEs)**, and apply them for **Anomaly Detection**, **Data Augmentation** by generating new instances of the data, and **Non-Linear Dimensionality Reduction**.

    - Explore the world of **Diffusion Models**, the state-of-the-art in image generation.
