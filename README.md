## Self-Learning - AI

### Learn scikit-learn's User Guide

Scikit-learn's website provides a detailed user guide for the `sklearn` library for different machine learning tasks. This user guide page offers detailed section navigation containing interesting topics in machine learning. Here are the top three topics on the list:

1. Supervised learning

2. Unsupervised learning

3. Model selection and evaluation

For this, I created a GitHub repository containing all the content. The job is to learn about some parts of it over time and add the corresponding notebook to it:

Github repo **Machine-Learning-With-Scikit-Learn**: [https://github.com/JamorMoussa/Machine-Learning-With-Scikit-Learn](https://github.com/JamorMoussa/Machine-Learning-With-Scikit-Learn)

When some sections are completed, I will add them to my website.

Here are some useful links:

### Learn About Optimizers for Deep Learning

1. Learn about gradient-based optimization algorithms for deep learning, including stochastic gradient descent (SGD), AdaGrad, Adam, etc.

2. Make a full comparison analysis of all these algorithms, highlighting the advantages and drawbacks of each of them.

3. Work on some helping extensions and functions (Python library) that provide some plots of hyperparameters of each of these optimizers to help understand them better and assist in deciding which optimizer may be useful for a specific task.
