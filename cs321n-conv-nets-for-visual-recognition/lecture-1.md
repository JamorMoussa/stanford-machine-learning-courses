## 0.1 Image Classification 

### 1.1 Motivation 

**Image Classification Problem** is the task of assigning a label to the input image. This problem is one of the core problems in **Computer Vision**. Despite its simplicity, it has many applications and can be reduced to **Image Classification Problem**.

### 1.2 What's Image? Computer Perspective

**Computers** see images as a 3-dimensional array in the **RGB** Color space, which extends for **Red**, **Green**, **Blue**.The following image is a cat image with 248 pixels wide, and 400 pixels tall, the third dimension is the color dimension. The whole idea with **Image Classification** is to build a **Machine Learning Model**, that can predict the label of this image as a cat.
